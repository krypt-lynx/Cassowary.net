Improvements:
  * documentation
    - check for formatting errors
    - complete the documentation
    - generate MSDN style online documentation using NDoc
  * Tests
    - Moving tests into a uni testing project has probably broken the makefile. Unfortunately I have no idea how makefiles work so I can't fix this.
